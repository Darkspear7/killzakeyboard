- Slow Firefox performance
- Silent Gap when loopping ogg files in Firefox
- Levels end sooner than they should
- Progress bar doesn't fill in completely anymore
- Suspicious Cookie Behaviour in Chrome - not creating cookies (might not apply anymore since THE Cookie, additional testing required).
- Suspicious Cookie Behaviour in Chrome - music was on but now playing, sfx was on and playing (cookie failure?)
- Safari fails to display canvas
- Scaling not working in Opera
- IE10 has some sort of ActiveX block/confirmation (should be bypassed by default).

Backlog
